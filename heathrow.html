						<h1>London Heathrow Airport Website - Redesign</h1>
						<p>London Heathrow website redesign that caters the need of the user waiting at the airport so that they can look information about the Heathrow Airport, buy some souvenirs for their family, some booze from the duty-free grabs a bite before they check-in.</p>
						<h4>Problem Statement :</h4>
						<p>Suppose for an instance we have Jake jones a digital marketing professional who has been in London for 3 days on work. The hotel he's staying at has a strict check-out policy - he would have to pay extra if he doesn't check out after 10:00 am.<br>His return flight to Mumbai from London Heathrow is at 5:00 pm, he is expected to report at the airline counter around 3 pm. Which leaves him with 3 hours to kill. 3 hours is not enough for him to catch any sights in London. <br>So, he's left with only one option - spending that time at the airport. Maybe a good opportunity to buy souvenirs for his family, some booze from the duty free and grab a quick bite before he checks-in.<br>He has a wife & 1-year-old son and he loves Japanese food.</p>
						<blockquote>
						    <p>The Aim is to design a set of airport information pages (web pages) or a microsite which is responsive and caters to his needs, so he can look information about the Heathrow airport to maximise those 3 hours.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h4>Team :</h4>
						<p>None</p>
						<h4>Technologies Used :</h4>
						<p>Photoshop, Invision, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery</p>
						<h4>Role :</h4>
						<p>Design A Redesign Concept of Heathrow which actually Solves all these Problems. Also code it up in such a way that it will run very fine on all instances(Mobiles, Tablets, Desktops and Large Desktops).</p>

						<span>The Homepage</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Aim is to provide as much as information about the Heathrow throw Homepage whether it's about the shopping, facilities, ticket offers, Dinner and drinks I tried to push each information possible. As it is the page where most of the audience lands.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li> 
								<p>It contains a set of sections each providing a particular information or service. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Added a boutique section at the bottom of this so that the user can pre-book the order and can easily collect it before the flight takes off.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>On the top the page you can see a ticket offers a section that are the special offers available only on Heathrow.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<blockquote>
							<p>This Page gives us the exact brief view on what we are going to have in the entire site.</p>

						<span>Shop and dine Page</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>The Idea behind this page to make the time and space count. I tried to save the time of the user by using the filter to help him search exactly what he is searching for so that he can quickly take a bite and grab some souvenirs for his family before he leaves.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li> 
								<p>This section also contains some of the Heathrow boutique parts with the best deals. Also the list of brands to choose from at the bottom of the page. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>At the top of the page, we have the tabs names the dine and shop so that we can easily switch into different sections. All you need to do is choose a tab and further sub-filters in that tab i.e. Terminal(T1, T2, T3), Location(Before Security, After Security), Category(Superfast lunch, Cheap Dine, Luxury Dines) and Search by keyword.

						<span>Shopping directory page</span>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>This section contains a set of cards displaying the image for the particular shop and some description about that store. Also, a link to know more about the store and know its exact location.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li> 
								<p>These cards also show the terminals information i.e. we can check if the store is available near your terminal or not. </p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>If the user is looking for something specific then he can use the custom filters to filter the result he is actually looking for and save his time if he does not have that time left for the check-in.
